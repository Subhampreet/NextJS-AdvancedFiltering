<h1>Next JS Advanced Filtering </h1>

This project aims to create a full-stack web application utilizing Next.js, Upstash, Chakra UI, and Tailwind CSS. The application implements a filtering system allowing users to filter and sort data efficiently. React Query is used for data fetching and caching, while schema validation ensures data integrity and security.
